# Kent Gale Automation Project Roadmap

*Last Updated: 2025-09-24*  
*Next Review: 2025-10-01*

## Project Overview
Multi-AI automation system for personal and business workflows across Mac/Windows platforms with full AI collaboration governance.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Implementation Phase - Moving from Foundation to AI Orchestration
- **Primary Focus**: Repository setup and agent routing system implementation
- **Key Blockers**: None currently

## Strategic Objectives

### 1. Foundation Infrastructure âœ… **50% COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Establish robust, cross-platform automation foundation
- [âœ…] Project management system (roadmap + task tracking)
- [ðŸŸ¡] Repository setup and professional documentation (in progress)
- [ðŸŸ¡] Cross-platform file system automation (Mac/Windows)
- [ðŸŸ¡] Git-based documentation system with live Dropbox sync
- [ ] Multi-AI collaboration framework and capability mapping
- [ ] Session continuity and context management between AI systems
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: In Progress (50% complete)
- **Notes**: Project management complete, now implementing repository and file system automation

### 2. AI Orchestration System âœ… **CURRENT FOCUS**
**Goal**: Seamless handoffs and collaboration between AI systems
- [ðŸŸ¡] Agent routing and observability system (implementing)
- [ðŸŸ¡] Job schemas and validation framework (implementing)
- [ðŸŸ¡] Machine inventory and capability mapping
- [ ] Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini capability mapping by platform
- [ ] Automated context sharing between AI systems via shared docs
- [ ] Session handoff protocols and templates
- **Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure (repository setup)
- **Status**: Active Implementation
- **Notes**: Building routing system with JSON schemas, policy engine, and live job queuing

### 3. Personal Productivity Automation
**Goal**: Automate routine personal tasks and workflows
- [ ] Things integration for task management
- [ ] Gmail automation and filtering
- [ ] Calendar integration and scheduling optimization
- [ ] Cross-device file synchronization (Dropbox/Drive)
- **Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure, AI Orchestration
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Notes**: Will leverage existing Things setup and Google integrations

### 4. Business Process Automation
**Goal**: Streamline consulting and business operations
- [ ] Client project documentation automation
- [ ] Proposal and contract templates
- [ ] Time tracking and invoice integration
- [ ] Knowledge base for consulting practices
- **Dependencies**: Personal Productivity Automation
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Notes**: Focus on systems-setup-reference integration

## Active Workstreams

### This Week's Priorities
1. **Complete repository professional setup** - README, LICENSE, description, documentation
2. **Implement agent routing system** - schemas, policies, router, examples
3. **Deploy merged specification bundle** - unified design, Claude convergence prep
4. **Set up live Dropbox integration** - job queuing, machine inventory, queue watcher

### Next Week's Targets
1. Test end-to-end job routing and execution
2. Complete AI capability mapping documentation
3. Set up automated cross-platform documentation sync
4. Begin personal productivity automation integration

## Key Decisions Pending
- [ ] **File sync strategy**: Dropbox vs GitHub as primary source of truth - *Impacts: Documentation workflow, AI access patterns*
- [ ] **AI task routing**: Manual vs automated AI system selection - *Impacts: User experience, system complexity*
- [ ] **Platform priority**: Mac vs Windows as primary development platform - *Impacts: Tool choices, testing approach*

## Learning & Development Needs
- **Technical Skills**: Git workflows, API integration basics, cross-platform scripting
- **Tools/Platforms**: GitHub Actions, Dropbox API, advanced Things automation
- **AI Collaboration**: Optimal prompting strategies, context management between systems

## System Integration Points
- **Dropbox**: [Current integration status and plans]
- **GitHub**: [Repository structure and workflow status]
- **Google Drive**: [Integration and sync status]
- **Other Tools**: [Calendar, email, etc.]

## Risk Management
- **High Risk**: [Major risks to project success]
- **Medium Risk**: [Moderate risks requiring attention]
- **Mitigation Strategies**: [How you're addressing risks]

## Success Metrics
- **Technical**: [How you measure technical progress]
- **Productivity**: [How you measure productivity gains]
- **Time Savings**: [Quantifiable time savings achieved]
