- [ ] Cross-platform file system automation (Mac/Windows)
- [ ] Git-based documentation system with live Dropbox sync
- [ ] Multi-AI collaboration framework and capability mapping
- [ ] Session continuity and context management between AI systems
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: In Progress (25% complete)
- **Notes**: Project management foundation complete, moving to file system automation

### 2. AI Orchestration System
**Goal**: Seamless handoffs and collaboration between AI systems
- [ ] Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini capability mapping by platform
- [ ] Automated context sharing between AI systems via shared docs
- [ ] Task routing based on AI strengths and platform capabilities
- [ ] Session handoff protocols and templates
- **Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure (project management)
- **Status**: Planning Phase
- **Notes**: Project management workflow created as first step

### 3. Personal Productivity Automation
**Goal**: Automate routine personal tasks and workflows
- [ ] Things integration for task management
- [ ] Gmail automation and filtering
- [ ] Calendar integration and scheduling optimization
- [ ] Cross-device file synchronization (Dropbox/Drive)
- **Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure, AI Orchestration
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Notes**: Will leverage existing Things setup and Google integrations

### 4. Business Process Automation
**Goal**: Streamline consulting and business operations
- [ ] Client project documentation automation
- [ ] Proposal and contract templates
- [ ] Time tracking and invoice integration
- [ ] Knowledge base for consulting practices
- **Dependencies**: Personal Productivity Automation

## Active Workstreams

### This Week's Priorities
1. **Test project management system** with ChatGPT to validate cross-AI workflow
2. **Set up cross-platform file automation** for documentation sync
3. **Create AI capability mapping** to guide task routing decisions

### Next Week's Targets
1. Integrate project-mgmt.md into bootstrap process
2. Set up automated Dropbox ↔ GitHub documentation sync
3. Create AI handoff templates and test with real scenarios

## Key Decisions Pending
- [ ] **File sync strategy**: Dropbox vs GitHub as primary source of truth - *Impacts: Documentation workflow, AI access patterns*
- [ ] **AI task routing**: Manual vs automated AI system selection - *Impacts: User experience, system complexity*
- [ ] **Platform priority**: Mac vs Windows as primary development platform - *Impacts: Tool choices, testing approach*

## Learning & Development Needs
