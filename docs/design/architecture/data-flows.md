# Data Flows

Authoritative data: [`data/data-flows.json`](data/data-flows.json)

## Active Flows

### Vikunja Web UI (F001)

```
Kent (Mac/iPhone) → HTTPS via Tailscale Serve → Vikunja :3456 → SQLite
```

Direct task management through the browser. Accessible from any Tailscale-connected device at `https://office2.tail0f5f56.ts.net`.

### Obsidian Vault Sync

```
Obsidian (Mac/iPhone) → Obsidian Sync cloud → office2 (ob sync --continuous)
```

Continuous sync daemon keeps the vault at `/home/kgale/second-brain/vault` current. Near real-time — no manual trigger needed.

### Nightly Backup

```
office2 (/data/services, /data/transcripts, /home/*) → Restic → /mnt/backups/restic-repo
```

Runs at 4AM daily via claude's crontab. GFS retention policy. Excludes transcribe models, temp files, and caches.

### Security Audit

```
audit.sh → compare running state against baselines → log alerts
```

Runs at 3AM daily. Checks: Docker images, enabled services, listening ports, SSH keys, crontabs, pip packages, hosts file, pth files.

### OpenClaw → Vikunja API (F007)

```
OpenClaw agent → HTTPS via Tailscale Serve → Vikunja REST API :3456 → SQLite
```

OpenClaw agents use the vikunja_api skill to create, read, update, and query tasks
via the Vikunja REST API. Authentication is via Bearer token read from the
credential store at runtime. Used by all downstream features that touch tasks.

## Planned Flows (Not Yet Implemented)

| Daily Briefing | F014 | Heartbeat → task summary → WhatsApp to Kent |
| Escalation Heartbeat | F015 | Vikunja label state → escalation logic → WhatsApp alert |
