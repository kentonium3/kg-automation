# Data Flows

Authoritative data: [`data/data-flows.json`](data/data-flows.json)

## Active Flows

### Vikunja Web UI (F001)

```
Kent (Mac/iPhone) → HTTPS via Tailscale Serve → Vikunja :3456 → SQLite
```

Direct task management through the browser. Accessible from any Tailscale-connected device at `https://office2.tail0f5f56.ts.net`.

### Obsidian Vault Sync (updated F010)

**Live sync** (Obsidian Sync — bidirectional):
```
Mac (Obsidian) ↔ Obsidian Sync cloud ↔ office2 (ob sync --continuous) ↔ Obsidian Sync cloud ↔ iPhone (Obsidian)
```

Three-device sync loop: Mac, office2, and iPhone all stay in sync via Obsidian Sync cloud. The `ob` CLI on office2 runs as a continuous daemon (`obsidian-sync.service`, kgale user unit). Changes on any device propagate to the others in near real-time. Obsidian Sync is the live sync mechanism — not git.

**Consumer**: `felix-admin-capture` reads from `/home/kgale/second-brain/vault/00-Inbox/` (3x daily via OpenClaw cron).

### Vault Snapshot (F010)

**Backup** (git — outbound-only):
```
office2 vault (/home/kgale/second-brain) → git add/commit → git push → GitHub
```

Daily git snapshot at 2AM ET via systemd timer. Outbound-only — never pulls. Provides backup and version history. This is not the live sync mechanism.

### Nightly Backup

```
office2 (/data/services, /data/transcripts, /home/*) → Restic → /mnt/backups/restic-repo
```

Runs at 4AM daily via claude's crontab. GFS retention policy. Excludes transcribe models, temp files, and caches.

### Security Audit

```
audit.sh → compare running state against baselines → log alerts
```

Runs at 3AM daily. Checks: Docker images, enabled services, listening ports, SSH keys, crontabs, pip packages, hosts file, pth files.

### OpenClaw → Vikunja API (F007)

```
OpenClaw agent → HTTPS via Tailscale Serve → Vikunja REST API :3456 → SQLite
```

OpenClaw agents use the vikunja_api skill to create, read, update, and query tasks
via the Vikunja REST API. Authentication is via Bearer token read from the
credential store at runtime. Used by all downstream features that touch tasks.

## Planned Flows (Not Yet Implemented)

| Flow | Features | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| WhatsApp Command Channel | F003–F006 | WhatsApp voice/text → OpenClaw → Whisper → Intent Parser → Vikunja |
| Obsidian Inbox Processing | F007–F010 | 00-Inbox → hourly processor → vault routing + Vikunja API |
| Daily Briefing | F014 | Heartbeat → task summary → WhatsApp to Kent |
| Escalation Heartbeat | F015 | Vikunja label state → escalation logic → WhatsApp alert |
