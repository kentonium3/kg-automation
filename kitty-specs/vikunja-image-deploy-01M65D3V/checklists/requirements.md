# Specification Quality Checklist: Vikunja image-archive staging and activation deploy route

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-30
**Mission**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, C-### and SC-### entries, and match the requirement-ID grammar
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Every FR row and success criterion carries a delivery label and no-op mark
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Mission Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Mission meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is an infrastructure deploy mission. Host identities (image digests, archive hashes, the bind address, the Compose file path, the `/api/v1/info` endpoint) appear in requirements because they ARE the acceptance targets, not implementation choices. The approach (language, file layout, library use, marker storage, snapshot mechanism) is left to the plan.
- Service-control decision resolved in the interview (DM 01M65D4SA1BBJA34C6PK32DQ7P): the activate entrypoint runs the unit's own Compose commands as claude.
