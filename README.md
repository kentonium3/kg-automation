# kg-automation

**kg-automation** is an open-ended initiative to build and maintain highly automated personal and business systems with AI.  
It serves as the single source of truth for governance, scripts, documentation, and design patterns that make up the automation ecosystem.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Automation-first** — remove manual steps, codify repeatable workflows.
- **Cross-platform** — support Mac + Windows, with cloud integrations (AWS, Dropbox, etc.).
- **Documentation-first** — every artifact (code, scripts, governance) is version-controlled here.
- **Agent-ready design** — systems are built to be safely executed by AI agents later.

---

## 🧭 Governance (Source of Truth)
- Governance lives in `docs/governance/ai-context-bootstrap.md` and the GitHub repo `kg_automation`.
- Avoid parallel governance docs; use thin per-AI adapters only when necessary.
- Principles: **automation-first**, **cross-platform**, **documentation-first**, **agent-ready**.

## 🗺️ Automation Roadmap
1. **Phase 0** — PDP beacons, heartbeat JSON (`Dropbox/Automation/.state/session_heartbeat.json`), Dropbox queue (`Dropbox/Automation/.queue/`)
2. **Phase 1** — Local watchers with visibility timeout + signed jobs; machine IDs remain local-only
3. **Phase 2** — Cloud backplane (AWS SQS, Step Functions, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB) with same JSON job contract
4. **Phase 3** — Observability (CloudWatch logs, metrics, alarms)
5. **Phase 4** — Security (IAM, Secrets Manager, signed job creation)

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/kg-automation.git
cd kg-automation

# (optional) Python venv
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# install base tooling (example)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔐 Security & Keys
- Never commit secrets. Use environment variables or a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager recommended).
- Job signing keys and machine IDs are **local-only** by policy.
